# JenkinsCI-CD
This Repo. used to alert the job on Jenkins with uploading files from Ubuntu
the file.py: is a Python script to create several directories that a user enters it.
the fileBash.py: is a Bash script to create several directories that a user enters it.
I used these files to check if git work with Jenkins while I am still learning Jenkins.
